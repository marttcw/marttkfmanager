* python3
* python3-dev 
* tkinter
* tix
* tix-dev
* python3-pil
* udisks2

In Debian/Ubuntu, install those gstreamer1.0 dependencies as follow:

```
sudo apt install python-gi python3-gi \
    gstreamer1.0-tools \
    gir1.2-gstreamer-1.0 \
    gir1.2-gst-plugins-base-1.0 \

Installation dependencies:

* cython3
* gcc
* python3-dev
* pkg-config

## Installation

Just run the install.sh with root. Ex: `sudo ./install.sh` or `su -c "./install.sh"`
You'll have to have the installation dependencies before you run the installation script.

## Configuration

It's important to put the "marttkfmanagerrc" file in your home directory as ".marttkfmanagerrc" if you want to have a proper configuration file.

## To-Do; Plans for later releases:

* Custom execution buttons
* Better GUI configuration
* (Maybe) drop-down for address entry
* Bookmarks
* Extra information on bottom about selected files
* (Unlikely) icons/thumbnails per files
* Gallery preview
* Better tabs (buttons to move between tabs)
